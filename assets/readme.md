## FAQ

### When is data enriched

**Outgoing data** (from Hull to Snov.io) is sent almost immediately. You can check the backlog on the _Overview_ page of your Snov.io Connector to see if there is any delay. Thus enrichment is almost immediate, however it might take snov.io to respond to the requested enrichment which is outside of the control of the Connector.
